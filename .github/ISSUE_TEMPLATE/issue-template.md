Thank you for reporting an issue for HTML-Mason. These days I (@autarch) don't use Mason and I'd love some help with maintaining. Ultimately, I'd like a co-maintainer who's still using it to take on PR review and the uploading of new releases to CPAN.

You're welcome to delete this text and report your issue, but please understand that in the absence of a new maintainer this issue probably won't receive much attention.
